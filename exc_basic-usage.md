## Hands-on! ü§ìüíª
\- Timeframe: 15min | Always work in your `$HOME` -

* Where in the filesystem are you and whats in there? Check out **`$PWD`** and **`ls`**. Also find out what the popular **`ls`** parameters **`-l`**, **`-h`** and **`-a`** do
* Create a folder structure with depth >= 3 using **`mkdir`**. Lookup how the parameter **`-p`** can help you. Now remove the whole tree with a single **`rm`** command
* Create a folder **`workshop`** in your **`$HOME`** directory. Use an *absolute Path* and the **`$USER`** variable in your command to do this
* Create empty files/directories and **`mv`** them around using *relative and absolute Paths* to get a feeling for it. Caution, it can destroy things.
* Create a new file with **`echo`** and content from below
* Now create the same file with **`cat`** and the **Here Document** way. Maybe you first have to find out what a **Here Document** is üïµÔ∏è
